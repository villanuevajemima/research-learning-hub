### Day 1: S3 Storage & The Medallion Architecture

- **Learning Objective:** Explain the Bronze/Silver/Gold data lake architecture and provision an S3 bucket with the correct folder structure.
- **Core Idea:** The Medallion Architecture organizes a data lake into three progressive layers — Bronze (raw data as ingested), Silver (cleaned and validated data), and Gold (aggregated, business-ready datasets). Each layer adds structure and quality, enabling downstream consumers to work with data appropriate to their needs without accessing raw sources.
- **Why It Matters:** Without a layered storage strategy, data lakes quickly become data swamps where raw, partially processed, and finalized data are indistinguishable. This makes pipeline debugging, data governance, and cost attribution nearly impossible. The Medallion approach gives engineers a clear separation of concerns and auditors a traceable data lineage from source to dashboard.
- **How It Works:** Raw data lands in the Bronze S3 prefix with minimal transformation and an append-only pattern. A Glue ETL job reads from Bronze, applies quality checks, and writes clean Parquet files to Silver. Downstream processes — either further Glue jobs or Athena queries — aggregate Silver into Gold, typically using Apache Iceberg for ACID compliance. Each layer is a separate S3 prefix with its own partition strategy.

  > This diagram illustrates the Medallion Architecture on AWS. Raw data is ingested into the Bronze layer, then cleaned and quality-checked by Glue ETL (passing to Silver, failing to quarantine). Silver data is aggregated into Gold Iceberg tables via Athena MERGE, and finally queried by Athena and visualized in QuickSight.

### Day 2: AWS Glue Data Catalog & Crawlers

- **Learning Objective:** Configure an AWS Glue Crawler to discover schemas and populate the Glue Data Catalog from S3 data.
- **Core Idea:** The AWS Glue Data Catalog is a centralized, Hive-compatible metadata repository that stores table definitions, schemas, partition information, and locations for data stored across S3 and other sources. Glue Crawlers automate schema discovery by scanning data sources, inferring column names and types, and creating or updating catalog tables without manual DDL.
- **Why It Matters:** A data catalog is the index of the data lake — without it, Athena, EMR, and Redshift Spectrum cannot discover or query data. Crawlers eliminate the need to write `CREATE TABLE` statements for every dataset, and they keep the catalog in sync as schemas evolve. This automation is critical for pipelines with frequent data uploads or schema drift.
- **How It Works:** A Crawler connects to a configured data source (S3 path, JDBC database, or DynamoDB table), samples files to infer structure, and writes table definitions to the Data Catalog. It detects partitions automatically from S3 folder structures (e.g., `year=2026/month=06/`). Crawlers can run on demand or on a schedule, and they can append new partitions or update schemas incrementally.

### Day 3: AWS Lake Formation & Column-Level Security

- **Learning Objective:** Set up Lake Formation to manage database permissions and enforce column-level access controls.
- **Core Idea:** AWS Lake Formation provides a centralized permissions layer on top of the Glue Data Catalog, allowing administrators to grant fine-grained access at the database, table, column, or row level. It replaces the need for individual IAM policy management across every analytics service.
- **Why It Matters:** IAM policies alone cannot restrict specific columns or rows within a table. A BI analyst querying a customer orders table should see order totals and dates but not `customer_id` or `credit_card_number`. Lake Formation enforces these restrictions at the query engine level — Athena, Redshift Spectrum, and EMR all respect its policies.
- **How It Works:** A data lake administrator registers S3 locations with Lake Formation and grants granular permissions to IAM roles or users. Column-level security is configured through data filters that include or exclude specific columns. When a user queries a table through Athena, Lake Formation intercepts the request and returns only the data the principal is authorized to see.

### Day 4: Apache Iceberg — ACID Transactions on the Data Lake

- **Learning Objective:** Describe how Apache Iceberg enables ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel on the data lake.
- **Core Idea:** Apache Iceberg is an open table format that adds a metadata layer between storage (Parquet files on S3) and compute (Athena, Spark, Trino). This metadata layer enables ACID transactions, row-level upserts (MERGE), snapshot-based time travel, and schema evolution — capabilities traditionally absent from data lakes built on plain Parquet or ORC files.
- **Why It Matters:** Standard data lakes cannot handle concurrent writes, row-level updates, or schema changes without complex workarounds. Iceberg solves these problems at the storage layer, transforming S3 from a simple file store into a transactional data platform. Engineers can run `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements through Athena, roll back to a previous snapshot, and add columns without rewriting entire tables.
- **How It Works:** Iceberg maintains a tree of metadata files that track table snapshots, partition data, and manifest files pointing to actual data files. Each write operation creates a new snapshot. Queries read from a specific snapshot ID, ensuring consistent views. The AWS Glue Data Catalog acts as the Iceberg catalog, storing the current metadata pointer.

  > This concept map shows Apache Iceberg's layered metadata architecture. The catalog points to the current metadata layer, which references manifest lists and manifest files that track which data files belong to each snapshot. Key features — ACID transactions, time travel, schema evolution, row-level upserts, and hidden partitioning — are enabled by this metadata layer. Multiple query engines (Athena, Spark, Trino) can read the same Iceberg table simultaneously.

### Day 5: Hands-on — S3 Environment & Lake Formation Setup

- **Learning Objective:** Provision an S3 Medallion bucket, run a Glue Crawler, and configure Lake Formation column-level security to protect sensitive data.
- **Core Idea:** This session puts the first week of theory into practice. Learners will create the actual S3 bucket structure (bronze/silver/gold), upload raw CSV data, run a crawler to catalog it, and enforce column-level security through Lake Formation so that a restricted user cannot see sensitive columns.
- **Why It Matters:** Storage and security are the foundation of any governed data lake. Without completing this setup, no downstream ETL or analytics work is possible. This hands-on ensures learners can replicate the same patterns in their own environments.
- **How It Works:** Using the AWS Console or CLI, the learner creates an S3 bucket with three prefixes (bronze/, silver/, gold/), uploads the Olist e-commerce CSVs to bronze/, runs a Glue Crawler to populate the Data Catalog, then uses Lake Formation to grant SELECT access to a BI Analyst role while explicitly excluding the `customer_id` column.

  - 📝 [AWS Lake Formation — Securing Data Lakes with Row-Level Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/cbac-tutorial.html)
- **Hands-on Activity:** S3 Bucket & Lake Formation Security Lab — The learner creates an S3 bucket with a bronze/silver/gold Medallion structure, uploads the Olist CSV data files, runs a Glue Crawler to catalog the Bronze table, and sets up a Lake Formation column-level security policy that masks `customer_id` from the BI Analyst role. The pass condition: querying the Bronze table as the BI Analyst role should return all columns except `customer_id`, which must produce a permission error.

### Day 6: AWS Glue PySpark — DynamicFrames vs DataFrames

- **Learning Objective:** Differentiate between Spark DataFrames and Glue DynamicFrames and write a basic Glue PySpark ETL script.
- **Core Idea:** AWS Glue provides a custom data structure called a DynamicFrame that extends the standard Spark DataFrame. Unlike DataFrames, DynamicFrames do not require a fixed schema upfront — they are self-describing and can handle schema inconsistencies (e.g., a column that is a string in some records and an integer in others) using a choice type.
- **Why It Matters:** Real-world data is rarely clean and consistent. A DataFrame will fail or silently coerce types when it encounters schema drift. DynamicFrames preserve the ambiguity and give the engineer explicit control over how to resolve schema conflicts through transforms like `ResolveChoice`. This makes Glue ETL jobs more resilient to messy input data.
- **How It Works:** A Glue ETL job creates a DynamicFrame from a catalog table or S3 path using `create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog()`. The engineer can inspect schema choices, resolve them with `ResolveChoice`, convert to a DataFrame with `.toDF()` for Spark SQL operations, and convert back with `DynamicFrame.fromDF()` for Glue-specific transforms.

---

### Day 7: DQDL — Declarative Data Quality Rules

- **Learning Objective:** Write DQDL rules to enforce data quality constraints within a Glue ETL job.
- **Core Idea:** Data Quality Definition Language (DQDL) is a domain-specific language for declaring data quality rules in AWS Glue. Instead of writing custom Python validation logic, an engineer declares rules like `IsComplete "order_id"`, `IsUnique "transaction_id"`, or `CustomSql "SELECT * FROM rows WHERE payment_value > 0"`. Glue evaluates these rules against incoming data and produces a quality score.
- **Why It Matters:** Writing custom data quality checks in Python is repetitive, error-prone, and hard to maintain across multiple pipelines. DQDL provides a standardized, declarative syntax that is readable by both engineers and analysts. It also integrates with Glue's native monitoring, publishing quality scores to CloudWatch.
- **How It Works:** A DQDL ruleset is defined as a list of rules inside a square-bracket block: `Rules = [IsComplete "order_id", IsUnique "order_id"]`. The ruleset is passed to the `EvaluateDataQuality` transform in a Glue ETL script. The transform evaluates each rule against each row and returns pass/fail results, which can be used to split data into clean and quarantine streams.

---

### Day 8: Quarantine Pattern & Bad Data Handling

- **Learning Objective:** Implement branching logic in a Glue job to route failed-quality records to a quarantine S3 prefix.
- **Core Idea:** When data fails a DQDL quality check, it should not be silently dropped. The Quarantine Pattern — also called the Dead Letter Queue pattern — routes failed records to a separate S3 prefix (quarantine/) where data stewards can review, correct, and reprocess them. This ensures no data is lost and the pipeline remains auditable.
- **Why It Matters:** Silently dropping bad data creates a false sense of data quality. Downstream reports may be incomplete without anyone knowing why. A quarantine folder preserves the failed records, provides visibility into recurring quality issues, and allows reprocessing after the root cause is fixed.
- **How It Works:** After the `EvaluateDataQuality` transform in Glue, the ETL script splits the DynamicFrame into two streams: one for passing records (written to Silver) and one for failing records (written to the quarantine S3 prefix). The script adds metadata columns — `dq_failed_rules`, `dq_timestamp`, `dq_source_path` — to quarantined records for traceability.

  > This flowchart illustrates the Quarantine Pattern in Glue ETL. Data from Bronze is evaluated against DQDL rules. Passing records flow to the Silver layer for downstream consumption. Failing records are written to a quarantine S3 prefix, trigger an alert to a data steward, and can be reviewed, corrected, and republished back to Bronze for reprocessing.

### Day 9: Performance Tuning — Partitioning, Compression & Grouping

- **Learning Objective:** Optimize Glue ETL performance through partitioning strategies, Parquet compression, and DynamicFrame grouping.
- **Core Idea:** Three key techniques significantly impact Glue ETL performance and cost. Logical partitioning (e.g., partitioning by year/month) reduces the data scanned by downstream queries. Columnar compression (Parquet with Snappy or ZSTD) reduces storage and I/O. DynamicFrame Grouping coalesces many small files into fewer, larger partitions before processing, reducing Spark task overhead.
- **Why It Matters:** A poorly configured Glue job can scan ten times more data than necessary and run for hours on a cluster with excessive DPUs. Partition pruning, compression, and grouping directly reduce both runtime and cost — often by 50% or more on real-world workloads.
- **How It Works:** Partitioning is defined when writing data: `df.write.partitionBy("year", "month").parquet(output_path)`. Compression is set via Spark configuration: `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.parquet.compression.codec", "snappy")`. Grouping is enabled with `glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(..., grouping=True, groupSize=1048576)`.

### Day 10: Hands-on — Glue ETL Job with Data Quality

- **Learning Objective:** Write a Glue PySpark job that applies DQDL rules, quarantines bad records, and writes clean Parquet to the Silver layer.
- **Core Idea:** This session integrates the ETL and data quality concepts from Days 6–9 into a single working pipeline. Learners will write a real Glue job that reads from the Bronze table, applies DQDL rules, splits passing and failing records, and writes clean Parquet to Silver.
- **Why It Matters:** Building a complete ETL job with embedded quality checks is the core skill of a data engineer working with AWS Glue. After this session, learners will have a reusable script template they can adapt for any Glue pipeline.
- **How It Works:** The learner authors a Glue PySpark script that: (1) reads Bronze orders and payments tables via the Data Catalog, (2) joins them, (3) applies DQDL rules that drop rows where `payment_value < 0` or `order_status IS NULL`, (4) writes the clean joined data to the Silver S3 prefix in Parquet format. Failing rows are quarantined to a separate S3 location.

- **Hands-on Activity:** Glue ETL with DQDL Lab — The learner writes a Glue PySpark job that reads Bronze orders and payments tables, joins them, applies DQDL rules (`payment_value >= 0`, `order_status IS NOT NULL`), quarantines failing records to a dead-letter S3 prefix, and writes clean Parquet to the Silver folder. Test: manually inject a negative payment value into the raw CSV and verify it is filtered out of the Silver output.


---

### Day 11: Airflow Concepts — DAGs, Operators, Sensors

- **Learning Objective:** Define the core Airflow abstractions — DAGs, Operators, and Sensors — and describe how they compose a pipeline.
- **Core Idea:** Apache Airflow structures pipelines as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). A DAG is composed of tasks, each represented by an Operator (e.g., `GlueJobOperator` to start a Glue job) or a Sensor (e.g., `S3KeySensor` to wait for a file). Dependencies between tasks define execution order, and the Airflow scheduler triggers DAG runs based on a schedule or event.
- **Why It Matters:** Without an orchestrator, ETL jobs must be triggered manually or through brittle cron scripts. Airflow provides a production-grade platform with scheduling, retry logic, dependency management, monitoring, and alerting. It is the industry standard for data pipeline orchestration.
- **How It Works:** A DAG is defined in a Python file that creates a `DAG()` context object and instantiates operators as tasks. Task dependencies are set with `>>` or `.set_downstream()`. The Airflow scheduler reads the DAG file, evaluates the schedule, and triggers runs. Sensors pause task execution until a condition is met — for example, `S3KeySensor` waits for a file to land in a specific S3 bucket.

  > This concept map shows the core Apache Airflow architecture. The Scheduler reads DAG definitions, tracks task states in the Metadata Database, and assigns work to Workers.

Advanced features — XComs, Variables, and Retries — add cross-task communication, configuration management, and error handling.

### Day 12: Amazon MWAA Environment Setup & Dependencies

- **Learning Objective:** Configure an Amazon MWAA environment including requirements.txt, plugins, and DAG deployment.
- **Core Idea:** Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) is a managed Airflow service that handles cluster provisioning, auto-scaling, and security patching. The engineer provides a requirements.txt file for Python dependencies, optional plugins.zip for custom Airflow plugins, and uploads DAG files to a designated S3 path.
- **Why It Matters:** Operating Airflow on self-managed infrastructure (EC2, EKS) requires significant DevOps effort — cluster sizing, logging, monitoring, and upgrades. MWAA abstracts this away, letting engineers focus on pipeline logic. It also integrates natively with AWS services like IAM, CloudWatch, and S3.
- **How It Works:** The engineer creates an MWAA environment through the AWS Console or CloudFormation, specifying an S3 bucket for DAGs, an execution IAM role, and a VPC with subnets. Python dependencies (e.g., `apache-airflow-providers-amazon`) are declared in `requirements.txt` and installed during environment creation. DAG Python files are uploaded to the `dags/` folder in the S3 bucket and automatically synced to the Airflow workers.

### Day 13: Advanced DAGs — XComs, Variables, Error Handling

- **Learning Objective:** Implement cross-task data passing with XComs, environment configuration with Variables, and error handling with retries and alerts.
- **Core Idea:** Airflow tasks run in isolation. XComs (cross-communications) allow passing small amounts of metadata between tasks — for example, passing a `GlueJobRunId` from a `GlueJobOperator` to a downstream sensor. Variables provide a key-value store for environment configuration (e.g., S3 bucket names, database connection strings).
- **Why It Matters:** Real pipelines require tasks to share state. A Glue job produces a JobRunId that an AthenaOperator needs to check status. A pipeline should retry on transient failures and alert when retries are exhausted. These patterns separate production-grade DAGs from toy examples.
- **How It Works:** An operator pushes an XCom value using `task_instance.xcom_push(key="job_run_id", value=run_id)`. Downstream tasks pull it with `task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids="glue_task", key="job_run_id")`. Retries are configured with `default_args={"retries": 3, "retry_delay": timedelta(minutes=5)}`. Alert callbacks push notifications to Slack or SNS on failure.

### Day 14: Hands-on — Building an MWAA DAG

- **Learning Objective:** Build a complete Airflow DAG in MWAA that chains an S3 sensor, a Glue job trigger, and an Athena query with error handling.
- **Core Idea:** This session combines all Week 3 theory into a single, working DAG. The pipeline waits for a trigger file in S3, runs the Glue ETL job from Day 10, executes an Athena MERGE query to update the Gold Iceberg table, and includes retry and alert logic.
- **Why It Matters:** Automating the full ETL pipeline — from data arrival to dashboard-ready Gold tables — is the goal of pipeline orchestration. After this session, learners will have a reusable DAG template for any Glue + Athena pipeline.
- **How It Works:** The DAG defines four tasks in sequence: (1) `S3KeySensor` waits for a trigger file in the Bronze bucket, (2) `GlueJobOperator` starts the Glue job from Day 10, (3) `AthenaOperator` runs a `MERGE INTO gold.table ...` statement to aggregate Silver data into the Gold Iceberg table, (4) a `PythonOperator` or `S3KeySensor` verifies the Gold table was updated.

  - 📝 [Apache Airflow — AthenaOperator Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/stable/operators/athena.html)
- **Hands-on Activity:** MWAA DAG Lab — The learner creates a DAG file (`ecommerce_pipeline.py`) with an S3KeySensor waiting for a trigger file, a GlueJobOperator running the ETL job from Day 10, and an AthenaOperator running a MERGE statement to update the Gold table. Retry logic (3 retries, 5-minute delay) is configured. The learner uploads the DAG to the MWAA environment, drops a trigger file into S3, and verifies all tasks complete successfully in the Airflow UI.

### Day 15: IAM Roles & Least-Privilege Policies for Glue / Athena [GAP]

- **Learning Objective:** Design least-privilege IAM policies that grant each AWS service only the permissions required for its pipeline role.
- **Core Idea:** Least-privilege access means each IAM role has exactly the permissions needed to perform its function and no more. A Glue Crawler role needs `s3:GetObject` on source buckets and `glue:CreateTable` on the Data Catalog. A QuickSight role needs `athena:StartQueryExecution` and `s3:GetObject` on the query results bucket — but not `s3:DeleteObject` on the source data.
- **Why It Matters:** Overly permissive IAM policies are the leading cause of data breaches in AWS. A single compromised role with `s3:*` access can expose the entire data lake. Least-privilege policies limit blast radius, satisfy compliance requirements (SOC 2, PCI-DSS), and make audit reviews straightforward.
- **How It Works:** The engineer creates separate IAM roles for each service: `GlueCrawlerRole`, `GlueETLJobRole`, `MWAAExecutionRole`, `AthenaWorkgroupRole`, `QuickSightRole`. Each role's inline policy enumerates only the required actions on specific resource ARNs. IAM Access Analyzer reviews these policies for unintended access and generates refined policy suggestions.

### Day 16: Athena Workgroups & Cost Management

- **Learning Objective:** Configure Athena Workgroups to enforce data-scan limits and isolate query environments between teams.
- **Core Idea:** Athena Workgroups are logical containers that separate query execution, history, and cost tracking across teams or applications. Each workgroup can have its own query result location, encryption settings, data usage limits (per-query and per-workgroup), and CloudWatch metrics — enabling administrators to control costs and audit usage independently.
- **Why It Matters:** Athena charges per terabyte scanned. A single runaway query scanning 50 TB can cost hundreds of dollars. Workgroups prevent this by enforcing per-query data scan caps. They also isolate query environments so an engineering team's experimental queries do not affect the analytics team's dashboards.
- **How It Works:** The administrator creates workgroups (e.g., `data-engineering`, `analytics`, `ad-hoc`) and assigns IAM policies that restrict users to specific workgroups. Per-query limits (e.g., 10 TB max per query) are set in the workgroup settings. Workgroup-wide daily limits trigger SNS alerts when breached. CloudWatch captures per-workgroup metrics for cost allocation.

### Day 17: SQL for Iceberg — MERGE, UPDATE, Time Travel

- **Learning Objective:** Execute Iceberg-specific SQL operations in Athena including MERGE (upsert), row-level UPDATE, and time travel queries.
- **Core Idea:** Apache Iceberg extends Athena's SQL capabilities beyond read-only `SELECT`. Using standard SQL, an engineer can run `MERGE INTO` for upserts (insert or update matching rows), `UPDATE` and `DELETE` for row-level modifications, and `SELECT ... FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` for time travel — querying a table as it existed at a previous snapshot.
- **Why It Matters:** Traditional data lakes cannot update or delete individual rows. Business requirements like GDPR right-to-erasure, daily revenue aggregation updates, and point-in-time reporting all require these capabilities. Iceberg brings warehouse-like DML to the data lake without moving data out of S3.
- **How It Works:** A `MERGE INTO` statement reads the current snapshot, applies the upsert logic, and writes a new snapshot: `MERGE INTO gold.revenue_summary t USING silver.daily_orders s ON t.order_id = s.order_id WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.revenue = s.total WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (order_id, revenue) VALUES (s.order_id, s.total)`. Time travel queries reference previous snapshots: `SELECT * FROM gold.revenue_summary FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2026-05-01 00:00:00'`.

### Day 18: QuickSight Dashboards & Data Dictionary

- **Learning Objective:** Build an executive dashboard in QuickSight connected to Athena and document the data catalog with a Data Dictionary.
- **Core Idea:** Amazon QuickSight is a serverless BI service that connects directly to Athena and creates interactive dashboards with KPIs, charts, and filters. A Data Dictionary documented in the Glue Catalog (via table and column descriptions) translates technical schema names into business terminology so analysts and business users can discover and trust datasets.
- **Why It Matters:** A pipeline is only as valuable as its output. Dashboards turn transformed data into business decisions. Without a Data Dictionary, a column named `cust_act_dt` is meaningless to a finance analyst — adding a description ("Date the customer account was last activated") makes the data usable and reduces misinterpretation.
- **How It Works:** The engineer connects QuickSight to the Athena Gold database, selects the aggregated Iceberg table, and builds visuals: Total Revenue KPI, Late Delivery Rate KPI, Daily Revenue Trend line chart, and Order Status pie chart. The Data Dictionary is populated by adding `COMMENT` entries to Glue Catalog tables and columns via `ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('comment' = 'description')`.

### Day 19: Capstone — Part 1 (Storage, Catalog & ETL)

- **Learning Objective:** Build the storage foundation and ETL pipeline for a governed e-commerce data lake using S3, Glue Catalog, and Glue ETL with DQDL.
- **Core Idea:** The capstone integrates all skills from Weeks 1–2 into a single project. The learner provisions the Medallion S3 structure, catalogs data, writes a Glue ETL job with DQDL quality rules and quarantine routing, and validates the output against business requirements — exactly as they would in a production data engineering role.
- **Why It Matters:** This is the first half of an end-to-end governed data lake. Completing this validates that the learner can independently provision, catalog, transform, and quality-check data using AWS serverless services.
- **How It Works:** The learner (1) creates an S3 bucket with bronze/silver/gold/ paths, (2) runs a Glue Crawler on the Bronze folder, (3) authors a Glue ETL job that reads Bronze tables, applies DQDL rules (`IsComplete "order_id"`, `CustomSql "payment_value >= 0"`), quarantines failures to a quarantine/ prefix, and writes clean Parquet to Silver, (4) enables Iceberg on the Gold table for atomic commits, (5) runs `DESCRIBE` queries in Athena to verify schema and column comments are populated.
- **Supplemental Reading:**

  - 📝 [AWS Glue — Data Quality Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/data-quality-getting-started.html)
- **Hands-on Activity:** Capstone Part 1 — The learner creates the S3 Medallion bucket structure, runs a Glue Crawler on Bronze, writes a Glue PySpark ETL job with DQDL rules that quarantine bad records, and writes clean Parquet to Silver. The pass condition: data that fails quality checks must appear in the quarantine/ prefix and NOT in the Silver Parquet output. Verification is done through Athena queries.

### Day 20: Capstone — Part 2 (Orchestration, Dashboard & Final Testing)

- **Learning Objective:** Complete the pipeline by adding MWAA orchestration, an Athena-powered QuickSight dashboard, and end-to-end testing with quality and governance validation.
- **Core Idea:** The second half of the capstone adds the orchestration and visualization layers. The learner writes an Airflow DAG that automates the ETL pipeline, builds a QuickSight dashboard on the Gold table, and runs end-to-end tests that validate data quality, governance restrictions, and metadata completeness.
- **Why It Matters:** This is the complete data lifecycle — from raw ingestion to governed, orchestrated, and visualized data. Passing this capstone demonstrates readiness to build production-grade data pipelines on AWS independently.
- **How It Works:** The learner (1) writes an MWAA DAG (`S3KeySensor → GlueJobOperator → AthenaOperator`) that triggers the Glue ETL job and updates the Gold table via MERGE, (2) connects QuickSight to Athena Gold and builds KPI dashboards, (3) runs governance tests: DESCRIBE to verify column comments, and a restricted-user query to confirm Lake Formation column masking is enforced.

  - 📝 [Amazon QuickSight — Dashboard Creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/creating-a-dashboard.html)
- **Hands-on Activity:** Capstone Part 2 — The learner creates an MWAA DAG that orchestrates the Glue ETL job and Athena MERGE, builds a QuickSight dashboard connected to Athena Gold, and runs governance tests: (1) quality test — upload a file with negative prices and verify they are quarantined, (2) metadata test — run DESCRIBE to confirm column comments exist, (3) governance test — attempt to query a restricted column with a limited-access user and verify it fails.
