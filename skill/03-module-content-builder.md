# Skill 3: Module Content Builder

> **When to use this:** Use this skill after Checkpoint 2 is confirmed — when the learning path skeleton, day breakdown, and visual flags have all been approved. This skill writes the full content for all modules at once.

---

## How to Trigger This Skill

Copy the prompt below and paste it into your Research & Learning Hub project. Provide the confirmed learning path skeleton from Skill 2.

---

## The Prompt

```
SKILL: Module Content Builder

The confirmed learning path skeleton is as follows:
[PASTE CONFIRMED SKELETON FROM SKILL 2 OUTPUT HERE]

---

Before writing any content, do the following:

1. Scan all days flagged as [HANDS-ON RECOMMENDED]
2. For each flagged day, ask:
   "Day [X] — [Topic Name] is flagged for a hands-on activity.
   What should the hands-on activity focus on? Please describe the task,
   tool, or exercise in mind, or say 'suggest one' to have AI propose an idea."
3. List all [HANDS-ON RECOMMENDED] days together in one message and wait
   for all answers before writing anything.

Do not begin writing module content until all hands-on activities are clarified.

---

Once all hands-on activities are confirmed, build ALL modules at once using
the following structure for each day:

---

#### Day [X]: [Topic Name]

- **Learning Objective:** [Carry over from skeleton — do not rewrite]
- **Core Idea:** [2-3 sentences. Technical and precise but simple and digestible — avoid heavy academic tone. If key terms or concepts are introduced, define them in a parenthetical or immediately following sentence. Written in 3rd person.]
- **Why It Matters:** [2-3 sentences. Explain the real-world relevance and practical importance. Technical where needed, digestible always. Written in 3rd person.]
- **How It Works:** [2-3 sentences. Explain the mechanism, process, or application. Technical where needed, digestible always. Written in 3rd person.]
- **Supplemental Reading:**
  - 📄 [Official Documentation — source name]: [URL]
  - 📝 [Blog/Medium Article — source name]: [URL]
  - 📝 [Blog/Medium Article — source name]: [URL]
  > ⚠️ Note: All links must be validated by the owner before publishing. AI suggests links based on credibility — accuracy and availability are confirmed at Checkpoint 3.
- **Hands-on Activity:** *(if applicable)* [Title of activity] — [2-3 sentence description of what the learner will do, what tool or environment is used, and what the expected outcome is. Written in 3rd person.]
- **Visual Aid:** ✅ [Flag status: Yes/No] — [1 sentence describing what the diagram should show] [VISUAL PENDING — Skill 4]

---

Repeat this structure for every day in the learning path.

---

Constraints:
- All content written in 3rd person — no you / I / me / we / your / our
- Core Idea / Why It Matters / How It Works are 2-3 sentences each — never more
- Tone is technical and precise but simple and digestible — no heavy academic language
- Key terms are always defined in the same bullet where they are introduced
- Supplemental reading: 1 official documentation link first, then 2 blogs or Medium articles
- Links from recognizable, credible sources only
- Do not write the quiz yet — that is Skill 5
- Do not generate visuals yet — flag them for Skill 4
- Do not rewrite or restructure days that are not being edited

---

End with this exact line:
"All module content is complete. Please review each day's content and
validate all supplemental reading links before proceeding to Skill 5:
Quiz Generator. If visuals are needed, trigger Skill 4 for flagged modules."
```

---

## What You Will Get Back

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hands-on Clarification Questions** | One message listing all [HANDS-ON RECOMMENDED] days with a question for each — asked before any writing begins |
| **Full Module Content** | All days written at once — Core Idea / Why It Matters / How It Works, supplemental reading, hands-on activity (if applicable), visual placeholder (if flagged) |
| **Visual Placeholders** | Modules flagged [VISUAL RECOMMENDED] will have a [VISUAL PENDING — Skill 4] marker with a description of what the diagram should show |

## Your Action at Checkpoint 3 (Part 1 — Content Review)

Once all module content is returned, review it and do one of the following:

- ✅ **Confirm** — "Content looks good, proceed to Skill 5"
- ✏️ **Edit one module** — "Rewrite Day 3's Why section — it needs to emphasize pipeline reliability more. Keep all other days exactly as they are."
- ➕ **Add something** — "Add a key term definition for 'idempotency' under Day 4's What section. Do not touch anything else."
- 🔁 **Trigger visuals** — "Trigger Skill 4 for Day 2 and Day 5 before proceeding to Skill 5"

## Your Action at Checkpoint 3 (Part 2 — Link Validation)

Before publishing or delivering any learning material, manually check every supplemental reading link:
- Confirm the link is live and accessible
- Confirm the content matches the topic
- Replace any broken or irrelevant links before finalizing

AI suggests links based on source credibility — final validation is always the owner's responsibility.

---

## Important: Editing a Single Module Later

If one module needs to be changed after content is complete, use this instruction:

```
Rewrite [SECTION] of Day [X] only.
[Describe what needs to change.]
Keep all other days and sections exactly as they are — do not touch anything else.
```

This prevents AI from regenerating the entire learning path when only one section needs updating.

## Example Trigger (What It Looks Like in Practice)

```
SKILL: Module Content Builder

The confirmed learning path skeleton is as follows:

METADATA
Title: Introduction to Apache Airflow

pipelines using Apache Airflow in a production environment.
Target Audience: Junior data engineers with basic Python knowledge
Prerequisites: Python basics, SQL fundamentals, command line familiarity
Tools Needed: Python 3.8+, Apache Airflow 2.x, Docker
Total Duration: 5 days, 2 hours per day

Day 1: What is Apache Airflow and Why It Exists [THEORY ONLY] [NO VISUAL NEEDED]
